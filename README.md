Description
The project uses superfluid streams and the callbacks built in to the protocol to mint access tokens to the account starting a stream. Tokens are used for access to subscription content and can be held by others with the owner maintaining the ability to transfer or recall the token to their own account. Ending or altering the stream will burn the tokens.

How it's made
The frontend is done in typescript, react, web3-react, ethers and the superfluid sdk. The back end in consists of a Superfluid app and tokens contract in solidity, hardhat, ethers. This is my first project ever and I've only been coding for a few months so I feel very good about what I was able to accomplish.

Technologies used


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
